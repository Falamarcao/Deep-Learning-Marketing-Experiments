Where Marketing Finds Deep Learning!

Using a classes from Deep Learning Foundations's course from Udacity as template, 
I built a classifier model collecting photos of 3 soda brands from their Instagram profile for training, 
and for test the prediction I have used some random photos collected from Google.

It's intereting, but I have to learn and work more over it for use in a real case.

For example, I have to selected better samples. 
The Pepsi profile that I selected has less photos than the other two brands.
And having less photos the model don't know with sure what its pepsi, 
and turn its a ambiguous for he to recognize which brand is Coca-Cola, and which brand is Pepsi.
